### About me

---

I have started my career as software engineer in a small company, I was dealing with implementation of layout in CMS Bitrix.
After I graduated from University, I worked as system administrator. The key aspect of my job was connecting and configuring computers. It was part-time job and I left this position simply because I feel I've reached my full potential, so I was ready for a challenge with a new organization.
Also I held the position as a head of the software and information support group.
I'm currently employed as a teacher in online IT-school. I teach courses on frontend development, game development in Roblox, computer literacy and game development in Scratch.

I can say that I'm an outgoing person and I've a way with people. I really into helping other people and I like to see how people rejoice in the goals achieved. This shows me of the importance of helping lifting others up.
